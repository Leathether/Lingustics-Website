            <p className="text-l bg-teal-900 p-5 pl-20 pr-20">Computers and Language: In terms of programming, do you suppose that computer programmer would have a descriptive or prescriptive mindset?  Now think about applications like voice assistants (like Siri).  You are hired to work for Banana, a company who is making a new voice assistant called Firi. The development team keeps talking about how the users of Firi ought to talk.  If the developers of Firi don't stop blaming the users, why is Firi bound to be a poor product?</p>

            <p className="text-l bg-teal-900 p-5 pl-20 pr-20">I have always thought programming to be very prescriptive. You are telling the computer what it ought to do, not what it is. In that respect, programmers would have a prescriptive mindset. When thinking about how the program is used, programmers often think prescriptively. Instead of thinking about everything it could be used for, they think about what it should be used for. </p>
            <p className="text-l bg-teal-900 p-5 pl-20 pr-20">If the developers of Firi keep blaming the users for not knowing or for not being able to use Firi instead of making Firi more accessible, then they are going to lose those people to more accessible programs. Video games are a great example of this concept. In a PBS article by Justin Stabley, he quotes the accessibility director at Xbox, Anita Mortaloni. Mortaloni states, “If there are barriers to play because a games not accessible or inclusive, people wont play it” (qtd. in Stabley). This same idea can be applied to most other programs. If there are barriers to using a program, people will not use it.</p>
